2048 clone written in C, played in the terminal

# HOW TO PLAY:
- Enter a direction for the tiles to slide, and all tiles on the board will slide in that direction until they hit the edge of the board, or another tile. 
- If two tiles of the same value bump into each other, they will merge into one tile double the value.
- A new tile is randomly placed after each move.
- If you fill the board and have no moves left, you lose.
- If you create a 2048 tile, you win!
