2048 clone written in C, played in the terminal

2048 is a tile-slding game with the objective of creating a 2048 tile. Users will enter a direction for the tiles to slide, and all tiles on the board will slide in that direction until they hit the edge of the board or another tile. If two tiles of the same value bump into each other, they will merge into one tile with the sum of the two values. The game will implement file handleing, classes, loops, and control statements.
