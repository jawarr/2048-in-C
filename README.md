2048 clone written in C, played in the terminal.

## How to Play:
- Enter a direction for the tiles to slide, and all tiles on the board will slide in that direction until they hit the edge of the board, or another tile. 
- If two tiles of the same value bump into each other, they will merge into one tile double the value.
- A new tile is randomly placed after each move.
- If you fill the board and have no moves left, you lose.
- If you create a 2048 tile, you win!

## Controls:
- w = slide board up ↑
- a = slide board left ←
- s = slide board down ↓
- d = slide board right →
- reset = reset the game
- exit = exit the program
- help = view the tutorial
